  [\#102](https://github.com/duckdb/duckdb-r/issues/102),
  [\#1090](https://github.com/duckdb/duckdb-r/issues/1090)). To enable,
  connect with `dbConnect(duckdb(), array = "matrix")`
  ([@joakimlinde](https://github.com/joakimlinde),
  [\#1125](https://github.com/duckdb/duckdb-r/issues/1125)).

  support ALTREP
  ([\#1130](https://github.com/duckdb/duckdb-r/issues/1130)).

- Improve developer experience:
  [`pkgload::load_all()`](https://pkgload.r-lib.org/reference/load_all.html)
  now works, source files are rebuilt if header files change, configure
  clangd ([\#1128](https://github.com/duckdb/duckdb-r/issues/1128)).

- Add dots with checks to unexported functions
  ([\#1115](https://github.com/duckdb/duckdb-r/issues/1115)).

  [\#1080](https://github.com/duckdb/duckdb-r/issues/1080)).

  . The `shutdown` argument to
  [`dbDisconnect()`](https://dbi.r-dbi.org/reference/dbDisconnect.html)
  or the [`duckdb_shutdown()`](https://r.duckdb.org/reference/duckdb.md)
  functions are no longer necessary. Two database connections from the
  same R session can access the same file concurrently in read-write
  mode ([\#124](https://github.com/duckdb/duckdb-r/issues/124)).

### Bug fixes

- Don’t run tests that invoke re2 by default
  ([\#121](https://github.com/duckdb/duckdb-r/issues/121),
  [\#127](https://github.com/duckdb/duckdb-r/issues/127)).

- Fix compilation for R 4.0 and R 4.1, regression introduced in v0.10.0.
  Using `librstrtmgr.a` from UCRT build of rtools40
  ([\#130](https://github.com/duckdb/duckdb-r/issues/130)).

### Internal

- The C++ core is now vendored commit by commit, once every five
  minutes. Vendoring stops if `R CMD check` fails or if a previously
  unreleased tag is reached.

- New maintainer: Kirill Müller.

### Continuous integration

- Add rhub2 workflow.

## duckdb 0.10.0

CRAN release: 2024-03-13

### Bug fixes

- [`dplyr::tbl()`](https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/reference/tbl.html) works
  again when a Parquet or CSV file is passed instead of a table name
  ([\#38](https://github.com/duckdb/duckdb-r/issues/38),
  [\#91](https://github.com/duckdb/duckdb-r/issues/91)).

- [`DBI::dbQuoteIdentifier()`](https://dbi.r-dbi.org/reference/dbQuoteIdentifier.html)
  correctly quotes identifiers that start with a digit
  ([\#67](https://github.com/duckdb/duckdb-r/issues/67),
  [\#92](https://github.com/duckdb/duckdb-r/issues/92)).

- Align the argument order of
  [`dbWriteTable()`](https://dbi.r-dbi.org/reference/dbWriteTable.html)
  with the DBI specs ([@eitsupi](https://github.com/eitsupi),
  [\#43](https://github.com/duckdb/duckdb-r/issues/43),
  [\#49](https://github.com/duckdb/duckdb-r/issues/49)).

### Features

- New [`tbl_file()`](https://r.duckdb.org/reference/backend-duckdb.md)
  and [`tbl_query()`](https://r.duckdb.org/reference/backend-duckdb.md)
  to explicitly access tables and queries as dbplyr lazy tables
  ([\#96](https://github.com/duckdb/duckdb-r/issues/96)). The `cache`
  argument to [`tbl()`](https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/reference/tbl.html)
  and to the new functions must be named.

- Initial ALTREP support for `LIST` logical type
  ([@romainfrancois](https://github.com/romainfrancois),
  [\#77](https://github.com/duckdb/duckdb-r/issues/77)).

- Update core to duckdb v0.10.0
  ([\#90](https://github.com/duckdb/duckdb-r/issues/90)).

- New private `rel_to_parquet()` to write a relation to parquet
  ([@Tmonster](https://github.com/Tmonster),
  [\#46](https://github.com/duckdb/duckdb-r/issues/46)).

### Chore

- Change directory location for extensions and secrets for v.0.10.0
  release ([@Tmonster](https://github.com/Tmonster),
  [\#73](https://github.com/duckdb/duckdb-r/issues/73)).

- Remove last instance of `default_connection()`
  ([\#50](https://github.com/duckdb/duckdb-r/issues/50)).

### Documentation

- Add list of contributors
  ([\#2](https://github.com/duckdb/duckdb-r/issues/2),
  [\#94](https://github.com/duckdb/duckdb-r/issues/94)).

- Use pkgdown BS5 ([@maelle](https://github.com/maelle),
  [\#31](https://github.com/duckdb/duckdb-r/issues/31),
  [\#70](https://github.com/duckdb/duckdb-r/issues/70)) with DuckDB logo
  ([\#76](https://github.com/duckdb/duckdb-r/issues/76),
  [@romainfrancois](https://github.com/romainfrancois)).

- Link to R documentation page.

- Include `NEWS.md` on CRAN
  ([\#48](https://github.com/duckdb/duckdb-r/issues/48),
  [@olivroy](https://github.com/olivroy)).

### Testing

- Add csv reading test for `duckdb_read_csv(na.strings = )`
  ([@Tmonster](https://github.com/Tmonster),
  [\#10](https://github.com/duckdb/duckdb-r/issues/10)).

- Fix snapshot tests.

- Tweak tests for compatibility with v0.10.0
  ([\#84](https://github.com/duckdb/duckdb-r/issues/84)).
