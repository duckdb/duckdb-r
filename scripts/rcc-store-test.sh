# Check the invariants the verdict store rests on, offline, against a local bare
# repository -- optionally seeded from the real `rcc` branch.
#
# The claims in handbook/operations/ci/per-commit/store/README.md are
# measurements, so they should be reproducible: this is what produced them.
# Seven things are checked.
#
#   1. N concurrent writers publishing at once lose nothing. Records land at
#      disjoint paths, so the only contention is on the ref, and the loser
#      re-reads the tip and re-commits rather than re-deriving.
#   2. A blobless, shallow, checkout-less clone stays small even against a branch
#      of a few hundred megabytes -- the property that makes publishing from a leg
#      affordable at all. This is the one that regresses silently: a stray
#      `git write-tree` without `--missing-ok` backfills every blob on the branch.
#   3. A newer verdict for a commit that already has one overwrites it -- which is
#      what a retry needs (.claude/skills/series-loop.md), and what a re-publish
#      of the *same* verdict must not cost anything -- and a verdict that stops
#      being a failure takes its log with it.
#   4. A fan-in whose run is *older* than what the branch already records leaves
#      it alone. Legs publish within seconds while a run takes hours, so an
#      earlier run's fan-in can outlive a retry that corrected it; replaying its
#      artifact must not put the overturned verdict back. A newer run still
#      replaces, and one unreadable record does not abort the whole fan-in.
#   5. scripts/rcc-consolidate.sh is a no-op as a dry run, drops records and logs
#      past their retention, squashes to two commits, inherits its empty root on a
#      second pass, and refuses to push over a writer that landed in between.
#   6. It survives every shape the branch can legitimately have.
#   7. scripts/rcc-cutover.sh turns an `rcc`-shaped tree into a two-commit `rcc2`:
#      the aggregate's records become parts, the flat logs move under the
#      fan-out, an attributable legacy log is recovered, and everything past the
#      window is gone.
#
# Usage:
#   scripts/rcc-store-test.sh              # synthetic branch, fast
#   SEED_FROM=origin/rcc scripts/rcc-store-test.sh
#                                          # seed from the real rcc branch, so the
#                                          # clone-size and cutover checks run
#                                          # against real data
#
# Environment variables:
#   WRITERS    - concurrent writers in the race check (default: 20)
#   PER_WRITER - records each publishes (default: 5)
#   SEED_FROM  - a ref holding an `rcc`-shaped tree to seed the remote with
#   KEEP       - if non-empty, do not delete the scratch directory
