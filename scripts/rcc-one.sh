# This is the gate set that the `rcc-smoke` job of `.github/workflows/
# R-CMD-check.yaml` applies on its per-commit `workflow_dispatch` path -- the
# path the retired per-commit dispatcher drove -- expressed as a script so that
# `scripts/each-shard.sh` can run it many times in one job. A workflow cannot
# loop over composite actions, so the gates have to be callable from a shell
# loop; this file is that seam.
#
# Deliberately a *subset* of what `rcc-smoke` does, matching what actually runs
# under `workflow_dispatch`:

#   | style                 | gate `style`                                    |
#   | update-snapshots      | gate `snapshots`, incl. the snapshot-<sha> branch |
#   | roxygenize            | gate `roxygen`                                  |
#   | commit                | gate `clean` -- workflow_dispatch fails on any diff |
#   | check                 | gate `check`                                    |

# Outcome semantics mirror `rcc-smoke` exactly: every gate runs even when an
# earlier one failed, and the exit status is the AND over all of them. That is
# what makes a failing commit's log show *all* the problems, not just the first.
#
# Assumes the caller has already installed R, the package dependencies, ccache,
# and the formatting tools, and that the working tree is a clean checkout of the
# commit under test.
#
# Usage:
#   scripts/rcc-one.sh
#
# Environment variables:
#   EACH_GATES            - space-separated subset of
#                           "style snapshots roxygen clean check pkgdown"
#                           (default: all of them, parity with rcc-smoke)
#   EACH_SNAPSHOT_BRANCH  - publish the snapshot-<sha>-rcc-smoke-null branch when
#                           the snapshots gate changed anything
#                           (default: true under GITHUB_ACTIONS, false locally)
#   EACH_STAGE_DIR        - when set, each stage's combined output is also kept
#                           in <dir>/<stage>.log and its verdict appended to
#                           <dir>/outcomes.tsv, so scripts/each-shard.sh can
#                           quote the failing stage into the run summary
#   RCMDCHECK_ERROR_ON    - passed through to rcmdcheck (default: note)
#   EACH_TIMEOUT_<STAGE>  - seconds a stage may take before it is presumed stuck
#                           and killed (see stage_budget below); 0 disables the
#                           bound for that stage

# stuck `Rscript` down with it. So a leg that runs out of budget kills this
# script and leaves the stage running -- measured, not feared: an orphaned
# `R CMD INSTALL` kept compiling after its leg was gone, and it would still be
# writing into src/ while the shard checks out the next commit.

# the stage's process group instead -- the one `timeout` created for it, which
# is every process the stage spawned.

# removes it on the way out, which a killed install never reaches. The library
# lives outside the workspace, so the shard's `git clean` does not take it

#
# The leg already has a `timeout`, but it is the whole shard budget (5 h), so a
# stage that hangs eats every commit the shard had left and takes its own
# evidence with it: run_stage buffers a stage's output and only prints it once
# the stage returns, and a killed rcc-one.sh never returns. That is how a hung
# `snapshots` gate came back as a bare "no test phase in log" and read like a
# cancelled leg.
#
# A per-stage bound turns that into an ordinary failure: the stage is killed,
# rcc-one.sh survives to print the partial log and mark the stage FAIL, and the
# remaining commits in the shard still get built. The numbers are the observed
# cost with plenty of headroom -- a full commit takes 313-2624 s all-in, and a
# cold-ccache build about 21 min of that -- so an honest stage never sees them
# and a stuck one is cut off in minutes rather than hours. Their sum stays under
# the shard budget, which keeps the leg's timeout the backstop it is meant to be.
