# Shared helpers for the verdict store on the orphan `rcc2` branch.
#
# Sourced, never executed:
#
#   here="$(cd "$(dirname "$0")" && pwd)"
#   . "${here}/rcc-lib.sh"
#
# ## The store
#
# One file per commit, under a 256-way fan-out on the first two hex digits of
# the SHA:
#
#   runs2.d/<xx>/<sha>.ndjson   the verdict -- one line of JSON, ~2 KB
#   logs2.d/<xx>/<sha>.log      the harvested output of a failure, ~1 MB
#
# and nothing else. Both directories are sharded for the same reason: adding one
# file rewrites one small tree rather than a tree with every record in it, which
# is what lets twenty matrix legs publish at once without a lock. Two writers
# recording different commits write different paths, so there is nothing to
# merge, and the loser of the ref race re-reads the tip and re-commits.
#
# There is no aggregate. `runs2.ndjson` was one file every writer extended, and
# so the one file two writers could genuinely disagree about; it bought "read the
# whole range in one fetch" and cost a merge step, a stale-line rule, a two-layout
# fallback in every reader, and half of the consolidation. Readers read the parts
# (see D2 in ../plan/PLAN-vendoring-simplification.md).
#
# ## Retention
#
# The store keeps `RCC_RETENTION_DAYS` (default 30) of history, records and logs
# alike, and `rcc-consolidate.sh` enforces it. That is one window rather than
# two, and it is load-bearing in both directions: a producer must not look
# further back than the window, or it re-derives every tick what consolidation
# drops, and a consumer must not ask about a commit older than it. Selection is
# bounded by `<S>-green`, which is far newer, and `rcc-logs.sh` derives its
# `SINCE` from this number for exactly this reason.
#
# ## Environment the clone helpers read
#
#   GH_TOKEN / GITHUB_TOKEN - token with contents:read (or write, to publish)
#   GITHUB_REPOSITORY       - owner/repo (required unless RCC_REMOTE is set)
#   GITHUB_SERVER_URL       - default: https://github.com
#   GITHUB_ACTOR            - commit identity, when one is needed
#   RCC_REMOTE              - remote URL, overriding the three above; how the
#                             test harness points a caller at a local bare repo
