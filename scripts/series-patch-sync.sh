# Carry `patch/` entries from `<S>-dev` onto `<S>-build`, the way stage 5 carries
# tests and glue onto a forward series.
#
# `vendor-one.sh` applies the *buffer's* `patch/*.patch` to every tree it
# regenerates, so the buffer is where an entry has to live to have any effect on
# what the series vendors next. Entries arrive on `-dev` two ways, and only one
# of them puts them there:
#
#   * a firing writes one during a repair -- stage 3 says to commit it onto
#     `<S>-build` in the same firing, and that is the half that works;
#   * stage 4's port carries whole `main` commits onto `-dev`, `patch/` files
#     included, so an entry born as a pull request against `main` reaches every
#     `-dev` without any firing deciding to put it there -- and reaches no
#     buffer at all, because `-build` takes no ports by design (stage 1).
#
# The second half is what this closes. The drift is quiet while upstream leaves
# the patched file alone, because the buffer is then internally consistent and
# its commits carry no delta for that file; it bites the first time upstream
# touches one, and the fix is reverted on `-dev` by a commit that reads as an
# ordinary vendor.
#
# **What carries is decided by test-applying, never by the file list.** A buffer
# runs ahead of `main`, so an entry that `main` needs may not fit the engine the
# buffer has vendored, and committing it there regardless would break the next
# vendor run outright (`vendor.sh`'s "patches moved" exit) rather than help
# anything. Each candidate is applied against the buffer's own tree first, and
# the three answers are three different situations:
#
#   carry      applies cleanly -- taken, with its effect on the tree
#   satisfied  reverse-applies: the effect is already in the buffer's tree, so
#              only the entry itself is taken, to keep the two stacks identical
#   stale      neither -- upstream moved the code out from under it. Reported and
#              left alone: on this series' engine the entry answers nothing, and
#              it reaches the buffer if and when the code it answers does.
#
# A candidate is any entry `-dev` has that the buffer does not have *in the same
# bytes*. Comparing names alone misses the entry `main` edits in place -- widened
# to cover more, or re-rooted after upstream moved -- which the port brings to
# `-dev` while the buffer keeps the old content, under a name that matches.
# `0009-Remove-stderr-for-zstd` is the standing example, and a name-only
# comparison calls those two stacks level.
#
# A candidate whose files are also touched by an entry the buffer has and `-dev`
# does not is a **supersession**, not an addition -- `0003-Fix-clang-warnings-in-re2`
# replacing `0003-Try-to-ignore-clang-warnings` is the standing example, the real
# fix displacing the pragma that used to stand in for it. Which of the two the
# buffer should end up with is judgement, and applying both is how the next
# vendor run breaks, so those are reported and never carried.
#
# Entries the buffer has and `-dev` does not are the series' own, written by a
# repair against an engine `main` has not reached. They are listed for the sake
# of the other direction of this question -- one that applies to `main`'s tree
# today belongs on `main`, where stage 4 spreads it by itself
# (.claude/skills/series-loop.md stage 3) -- and never removed here.
