# Git merge driver for DESCRIPTION.
#
# The package version carries two independent counters that advance on
# different strands:
#
#   * the 4th component is the R-client counter, bumped on the source-of-truth
#     strand (e.g. `main`): 1.5.3.9006 -> 1.5.3.9007 -> ...
#   * the 5th component is the vendor counter, bumped per vendor commit on the
#     `-dev` strands (see scripts/vendor-one.sh): 1.5.3.9006.41 -> ...42 -> ...
#
# A plain merge of the two strands conflicts on the `Version:` line on every
# commit. This driver resolves that line deterministically by taking the
# component-wise maximum of the two sides, gated on an equal major.minor.patch
# prefix. Because each strand owns exactly one counter (and freezes the other),
# the max automatically keeps the 4th component from the R-client strand and the
# 5th from the vendor strand. The prefix gate is a safety rail: a cross-release
# forward-port (e.g. 1.5.x -> 1.4.x LTS) keeps ours unchanged and never inherits
# a foreign prefix.
#
# All other lines of DESCRIPTION still go through a normal 3-way merge, so a
# genuine concurrent edit (e.g. two branches touching Imports:) still surfaces
# as a real conflict.
#
# git invokes this with:  %O = ancestor   %A = ours (= output)   %B = theirs
