# Read-only: what did r-universe make of the refs this repository publishes?
#
# `<S>-green` is what r-universe builds (.claude/skills/series-loop.md), on
# platforms the per-commit `rcc` gate never touches -- Windows on x86_64 and
# arm64, macOS on both, wasm. A series can therefore be green commit by commit
# and still ship a package that does not build, and nothing in the harvest on
# branch `rcc` would say so. This script is that missing read.
#
# For every package built from this repository it prints the version, the
# commit it was built from, the local ref that commit is (when this clone knows
# it), and one line per target that is not OK, with the URL of the log that
# says why.
#
# Usage:
#   r-universe-check.sh [<package>...]    # default: every duckdb-r package
#   r-universe-check.sh --log <job-id>    # the full job log, to stdout
#   RUNIVERSE="<name>..." r-universe-check.sh  # other universes
#
# Four access facts, each paid for once (2026-08-03, 2026-08-18):
#
#   * **The greens are published in more than one universe**, so reading one of
#     them answers for half the series. `duckdb.r-universe.dev` builds the base
#     series' greens, `krlmlr.r-universe.dev` builds the forward (`-fwd`) ones,
#     and a default covering only the first reports "all targets OK" while a
#     `-fwd-green` is failing (`main-fwd-green` bf48f2a8f, two macOS x86_64
#     targets timed out, 2026-08-18). Both are read by default; `RUNIVERSE`
#     takes a space-separated list to narrow or extend that. A universe holds
#     packages from other repositories too -- `krlmlr` publishes a dozen -- so
#     the default package list is filtered to those whose `_upstream` is a
#     `duckdb-r`; naming packages explicitly overrides the filter.
#   * The `/builds` dashboard answers 403 to some fetchers, and the apex
#     `r-universe.dev` may be unreachable where the per-universe subdomain is
#     not. Everything below is on `https://<universe>.r-universe.dev`, which
#     answers a plain curl.
#   * The build logs live in the GitHub repository `r-universe/<universe>`,
#     which needs authentication and is not a repository this project can be
#     granted. r-universe proxies them: `/api/actions/logs/<job-id>` serves the
#     complete job log anonymously. That is the `--log` mode, and it is the
#     difference between "Windows failed" and the compiler error.
#   * `/api/packages` alone cannot answer this question. Its `_binaries` array
#     is one row per *artifact*, so a target whose build failed outright leaves
#     no row -- and the row from the last version that did build stays, wearing
#     that older version. Reading it as the current state reports success for a
#     target that has been failing for a fortnight. The per-package page's check
#     table is version-scoped and complete, so that is the verdict source here;
#     `_binaries` is read only to report how stale the published binary is.
