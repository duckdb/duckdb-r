# Consolidate the orphan `rcc2` branch: drop everything past the retention
# window, and squash the whole history to two commits.
#
# Run by hand (`.github/workflows/rcc-consolidate.yaml`, `workflow_dispatch`),
# never on a schedule. Everything else that writes to this branch is additive and
# races safely (scripts/rcc-publish.sh); this one rewrites it, and the one thing
# that makes a rewrite safe is knowing nothing else is mid-flight. A schedule
# cannot know that. The force-push carries a lease, so if something did land in
# between, the push is refused rather than silently discarding it.
#
# ## Who owns what on the `rcc2` branch
#
# | Writer | Adds | Rewrites |
# |---|---|---|
# | an `each-rcc` leg | its own record and log | a verdict it is overturning |
# | the run's fan-in | records a leg could not publish | the same |
# | `rcc-logs.yaml` | records for commits it finds undecided | nothing |
# | **this script** | — | **all of it** |
#
# Everything routine is additive and lands one file per commit, which is what
# lets it run concurrently without coordination. The two destructive operations
# -- deleting what has aged out, discarding history -- are collected here, where
# they happen once and under supervision.
#
# ## What it drops
#
# Records and logs alike, past `RCC_RETENTION_DAYS`, plus any log whose commit
# has no record at all -- nothing reads those and nothing can date them.
#
# Dropping records, and not only logs, is what makes the retention window one
# number rather than two. A verdict for a commit decided months ago and long
# since repaired is read by nothing: selection is bounded by `<S>-green`, which
# is far newer, and a commit that somehow did fall outside the window would be
# rebuilt rather than misjudged. The window is load-bearing in the other
# direction too -- scripts/rcc-logs.sh derives its `SINCE` from it, so the
# backstop never re-derives what this script has just deleted.
#
# Logs are still the bulk of what goes: `logs2.d/<xx>/<sha>.log` is ~1 MB of
# harvested output per failed commit against ~2 KB for a record.
#
# Usage:
#   OUT_DIR=runs scripts/rcc-consolidate.sh            # report, change nothing
#   OUT_DIR=runs APPLY=1 scripts/rcc-consolidate.sh    # rewrite and force-push
#
# Environment variables:
#   OUT_DIR             - the `rcc2` worktree to consolidate (default: runs)
#   RCC_RETENTION_DAYS  - keep records and logs at most this old (default: 30);
#                         0 keeps everything, and then only the squash happens
#   APPLY               - if non-empty, commit and force-push; otherwise report
#                         what would change and leave the branch alone
#   BRANCH              - branch to rewrite (default: rcc2)
#   REMOTE              - remote to push to (default: origin)
