# Drop named commits' verdicts from the store on the orphan `rcc2` branch.
#
# A verdict is normally overturned by a newer run judging the same commit
# (scripts/each-shard.sh), and that is the route to prefer: it replaces one
# record with another and leaves the store self-consistent. This script is for
# the case that route cannot reach -- a verdict the *harness* decided, which no
# rerun of the commit as it stands would overturn, because the commit was never
# what failed.
#
# Removing the record is what makes the commit undecided: work selection reads
# presence and nothing else (scripts/rcc-decided.sh), so the next `each-rcc` run
# on the branch plans it like a commit that had never been built. The log goes
# with it, because a log whose record is gone is read by nothing and dated by
# nothing (scripts/rcc-consolidate.sh drops such orphans anyway).
#
# ## When this is the right tool
#
# When the job decided the commit rather than the tree. The shape it was written
# for: a change to `.github/workflows/` reaches every build in the job -- the
# composite actions are resolved from the branch tip that triggered the run, not
# from the commit under test -- so a bad one turns commits red whose own trees
# have nothing to do with it, at the scale of everything the run touched.
# duckdb/duckdb-r#2620 appended `-Wno-redundant-move -Wno-unused-parameter` to
# `~/.R/Makevars`, where `R CMD check --as-cran` read them and refused them as
# non-portable flags; 166 commits across three series were red for it, and every
# one of them went green once duckdb/duckdb-r#2652 had landed and the records
# were dropped.
#
# `retry-<S>-dev` is the answer for one commit and is not this (see
# .claude/skills/series-loop.md): it replans the tip of the retry branch alone,
# and it runs the workflow from the *retried commit's* tree, which is a
# different question from "judge it again under the tooling the branch carries
# today".
#
# ## When it is not
#
# A commit the tree genuinely broke is a repair, not a drop. Dropping its record
# only costs a rebuild to learn the same verdict again, and it erases the log
# that says why. The test is whether the same commit, built again on the branch
# as it stands now, would reach a different verdict; if the answer needs no
# change anywhere, this is not the tool.
#
# ## Two things it deliberately does not do
#
# It does not touch the commit's `rcc` commit status. That is a display surface
# and nothing decides from it -- but it means the commit still *shows* red until
# its rebuild writes a fresh one, which is expected, not a second thing to fix.
#
# And it must not be followed by dispatching `rcc-logs.yaml`. That workflow
# derives records for commits the store has no record for, from exactly those
# stale statuses, so a sweep behind a drop puts back what the drop removed.
#
# Usage:
#   scripts/rcc-drop.sh <sha>...          # drop these commits' verdicts
#   scripts/rcc-drop.sh --stdin < shas    # one SHA per line, `#` comments ok
#   scripts/rcc-drop.sh --dry-run <sha>...
#
# Environment variables:
#   GH_TOKEN / GITHUB_TOKEN - token with contents:write on the repository
#   GITHUB_REPOSITORY       - owner/repo (required unless RCC_REMOTE is set)
#   RCC_REMOTE              - remote URL, overriding the above
#   BRANCH                  - default: rcc2
#   RCC_DROP_REASON         - one line quoted into the commit message, saying
#                             what decided these verdicts if not the commits
