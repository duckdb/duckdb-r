# Publish a staging directory to the verdict store on the orphan `rcc2` branch.
#
# This is the only writer every producer goes through -- the matrix leg
# publishing one commit's verdict as it decides it (scripts/each-shard.sh), the
# run's fan-in reconciling what a dead leg could not (scripts/each-harvest.sh),
# and the scheduled backstop (scripts/rcc-logs.sh). They differ in what they
# stage, not in how it lands.
#
# One writer is possible because the store is one file per commit and nothing
# else (scripts/rcc-lib.sh): two producers recording different commits stage
# different paths, so there is nothing to merge, and losing the ref race costs a
# tree fetch and a re-commit rather than a re-derivation. That was not true while
# a single `runs2.ndjson` carried every record -- appending to one file from two
# places conflicts on essentially every collision, which is why the old push
# wrapper had to reset onto the winner and re-run the producer to recover. With
# the aggregate gone, so is the recovery, and so is the re-derive command every
# caller had to supply.
#
# The branch is reached through a blobless, shallow, checkout-less clone and
# written with plumbing, because the point is to *not* pay for it: a leg needs
# none of the store's harvested logs to add one file. `--filter=blob:none`
# fetches trees only, `read-tree`/`update-index`/`commit-tree` build the commit
# from the index alone, and the push sends the one new blob.
#
# Usage:
#   scripts/rcc-publish.sh <commit-message> <staging-dir>
#
# <staging-dir> mirrors the branch: every file under it is published at its path
# relative to the staging root. One name is reserved:
#
#   <staging-dir>/.remove   one on-branch path per line, to be deleted
#
# which is how a verdict that stops being a failure takes its log with it.
# Removals are applied after additions, so a path in both wins as a removal --
# but no caller should stage both, and nothing here pretends that is meaningful.
#
# Publishing what the branch already has costs nothing: blob ids are compared in
# the index, so identical content stages nothing and no commit is made. That is
# what makes a re-publish free and a retry -- where a commit is deliberately
# rebuilt on its own SHA to overturn a verdict that was never about its tree
# (.claude/skills/series-loop.md) -- land as a replacement.
#
# Environment variables:
#   GH_TOKEN / GITHUB_TOKEN - token with contents:write on the repository
#   GITHUB_REPOSITORY       - owner/repo (required unless RCC_REMOTE is set)
#   GITHUB_SERVER_URL       - default: https://github.com
#   RCC_REMOTE              - remote URL, overriding the two above
#   RCC_DIR                 - where the branch clone is cached between calls
#                             (default: $RUNNER_TEMP/rcc-publish); must be
#                             outside the workspace, which scripts/each-shard.sh
#                             wipes between commits
#   BRANCH                  - default: rcc2
#   ATTEMPTS                - pushes to try before giving up (default: 20; a
#                             retry is a tree fetch and the staged files again,
#                             and the backoff caps at 8 s, so the whole budget is
#                             ~2 min against a build measured in tens of them)
