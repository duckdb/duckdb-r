#!/bin/bash
# Build one shard of an `each-rcc` plan: many commits, one job, one workspace.
#
# Walks its slice of `plan.json` oldest-first, and for every commit resets the
# workspace to it, runs `scripts/rcc-one.sh`, and writes the `rcc` commit-status
# -- the same marker `scripts/each-rcc.sh` produces indirectly by dispatching an
# `rcc` run per commit. Downstream consumers (`scripts/vendor-gate.sh`,
# `scripts/rcc-logs.sh`, the repair skills) see no difference.
#
# Why the reuse works even though every commit starts from a clean tree:
# `R CMD build` copies the package and `R CMD check` compiles from the copy, so
# object timestamps never survive a commit anyway. The mechanism that does
# survive is **ccache**, which is content-addressed and lives on the runner's
# local disk for the whole job. A typical adjacent vendor commit recompiles only
# the handful of unity objects it invalidates -- ~98% hits, measured in
# scripts/VENDORING-LOOP.md, Appendix A.2. That is the whole point of putting
# consecutive commits in one job.
#
# Stopping is graceful, not fatal. The leg stops at its own deadline and reports
# what it did not reach, rather than being killed at GitHub's 6-hour job limit
# mid-commit. Progress is durable per commit (the status), so the next run simply
# replans whatever is left; nothing is checkpointed.
#
# Two consequences of "durable per commit" are load-bearing when a leg dies for
# reasons of its own -- a lost runner, a cancellation, a platform hiccup:
#
#   * The leg *resumes*. Re-running a failed job replays its whole shard from
#     plan.json, so without a check it would rebuild the commits it had already
#     decided -- up to five hours of work to redo, on a cold cache. A commit that
#     already carries a decided `rcc` status is therefore skipped here, which
#     makes "Re-run failed jobs" cost only what was actually lost.
#     Not every decided commit, though: a forced replan and the tip of a
#     `retry-<S>-dev` branch are in the plan *because* they already have a
#     verdict, and skipping those would make the retry a no-op. The planner
#     names them in `replanned_despite_verdict`, so the leg reads the intent
#     from the plan rather than trying to re-derive it.
#   * The leg *publishes as it goes*. Every verdict is pushed to the `rcc` branch
#     the moment it exists (scripts/rcc-part-push.sh), so a leg that dies takes
#     nothing with it but the commit it was in the middle of. The artifact and
#     the fan-in stay as the backstop for the push itself failing -- which is why
#     each.yaml names the artifact per run *attempt*: a resumed leg's index covers
#     only what it rebuilt, so overwriting would delete the previous attempt's
#     copy of anything that attempt decided but could not publish.
#
# Usage:
#   SHARD=1 PLAN=plan.json LOG_DIR=/tmp/each-logs GH_TOKEN=<token> \
#     scripts/each-shard.sh
#
# Environment variables:
#   GH_TOKEN          - token with statuses:write and contents:write
#                       (required unless DRY_RUN)
#   SHARD             - shard number from plan.json; 1 is the oldest slice of
#                       the plan and N the branch tip (required)
#   PLAN              - plan file (default: plan.json)
#   LOG_DIR           - where per-commit logs, records and the index are written;
#                       must be outside the workspace, which is wiped per commit
#                       (default: $RUNNER_TEMP/each-logs)
#   DEADLINE_MINUTES  - stop starting new commits past this (default: 300)
#   LOG_TAIL          - trailing lines kept per commit (default: 10000)
#   SUMMARY_TAIL      - trailing lines of every failed stage quoted into the job
#                       summary (default: 50; 0 keeps the excerpts out)
#   SUMMARY_MAX_BYTES - stop adding excerpts past this much summary text
#                       (default: 900000; GitHub truncates a step summary at
#                       1 MiB, and a truncated summary loses the table too)
#   FORCE             - if non-empty, rebuild every commit in the shard, decided
#                       or not; the plan's own `replanned_despite_verdict` list
#                       already covers the forced and retried ones
#   NO_PUBLISH        - if non-empty, do not push records to the `rcc` branch;
#                       the fan-in collects them from the artifact instead
#   DRY_RUN           - if non-empty, list the commits and exit
