The declaration sits here rather than in the front matter above, which belongs

rest on how an unknown key happens to be treated. The checks read it from
either place.

# Writing prose in this repository

_Derived from [`handbook/meta/authoring/`](/handbook/meta/authoring/README.md) and [`handbook/meta/style/`](/handbook/meta/style/README.md),
which own the prose rules,
and [`handbook/meta/handbook/`](/handbook/meta/handbook/README.md) and [`handbook/meta/forms/`](/handbook/meta/forms/README.md),
which own the tree's.
Those pages are the authority,
and [`handbook/meta/local/`](/handbook/meta/local/README.md) is what this repository decides beyond them.
All of them are shared pages whose home is `cynkra/handbook-tools`, and this file is carried from there unchanged.
This is the short form, and it loads when you touch a file that carries prose.
Fix the leaf first and re-derive this, never the other way around._

## Before writing a sentence

Walk these in order and stop at the first that answers.

1. Is it a fact about how things work today? Intent belongs where the local page says intent lives; history belongs to git and the logs.
2. Is it true? Verify against the thing itself before writing, not after review.
3. Does another handbook leaf, a file header, or a reference page own it? Link it, never restate or paraphrase it.
4. Does an artifact already state it? Never re-enumerate what a file lists; state the principle that locates it.
5. Could a check state it instead? A trap that keeps happening deserves a guard, not a paragraph asking readers to remember.
   A measurement too expensive to re-derive becomes an experiment record, linked from the leaf that leans on it.
6. Then write it, as short as it can be and stay correct, and leave a breadcrumb where the reader stands.

A behaviour that looks wrong rather than chosen is settled before the ladder:
a small fix beats a paragraph, and a real limitation is stated with the issue that will remove it.

## Writing the sentence

- Semantic line breaks: break at meaning boundaries, never mid-phrase, never a one-word line,
  never a line starting with one word and a comma.
- Aim for 140 characters, and let meaning win where it will not fit.
- A line ends with a full stop unless it is a heading, a bold run-in, a list item name, or a colon introducing a list.
- Default to a bullet list; make a table earn its columns.
- Name the mechanism rather than the count, treat a default as a fact by naming the value and where it is set,
  and never refer to anything by position.
- A comment says what the line does and names the leaf that says why;
  it takes the code's line budget, and every rule here holds inside it.
- Link a provisional fact to the issue or proposal that will change it, as a full link.
- Cite the claim, not its label: a number from another page's table means nothing where it is read.
- The rules this repository adopts beyond these, an em dash ban among the usual ones, are on the local page.

## Where the file lives in the tree

- A fact belongs on exactly one handbook leaf.
  If you are about to write a durable fact into a document outside `handbook/`, that is the signal to put it on a leaf and link it instead.
- Every document outside `handbook/` either declares its handbook sources in `derived_from:` front matter
  or carries a visible backreference to the node it serves.
  A document with neither is an orphan.
- Editing a document that declares `derived_from:` means editing its sources first, then re-deriving.
- Link a boundary once per page, and link the leaf that owns the fact rather than the node above it.
- Never number a living page; only an append-only artifact takes a number or a date in its name.
- Run `/docs:check` before you finish, and work the skill's judgment checks too when the change is substantial.

## Where these rules stop

A GitHub issue or pull request body takes reflowed paragraphs, because a single newline renders there as a visible break.
Structure is not prose: a YAML key, a path, and a command are what they are, and only the sentences around them follow these rules.
Generated files and anything vendored from a third party are nobody's to reformat: fix the generator or leave it alone.
